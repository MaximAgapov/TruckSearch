# Truck, food search.

## Task description

Develop a solution to help the San Francisco team find food trucks near their location and based on their preferred food. The solution should return at least the closest food trucks options based on latitude, longitude, and preferred food.

## Implementation Explanation.

For the implementation, a Clean Architecture template was used.

This template utilizes a Layered Architecture approach, structured as follows: Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure, alongside the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.

An In-Memory Database was utilized for this demonstration task.

Implementation had some simplification specific for demonstration task. But should present overview of my vision for application architecture.
